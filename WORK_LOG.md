I looked for patterns. |

I just shifted the value of the characters by 9. Next I started working on the ascii values in numbers, I converted the ints to chars using (char) int which gave me a letter that corresponded to the ascii values. |

| Aug 28 |    3:30     | I had previously gotten to the hexadecimal to decimal values, but hadn't figured out how to decipher that, so I just shifted it -9919 since I knew the truck was a space, and I finished the cipher. Now I start coding it. My thinking changed from initially plugging in reasonable letters to each emoji, but I realized that wasn't the correct way to solve the puzzle, so I tried other things like modulus 26 but that didn't work either. After class you said it was just shifted, so I decided that since we knew the truck is a space then I found the ascii value of the truck and found the difference between the 9988 and 32 and did the same for the rest. I was so close to figuring it out. |
