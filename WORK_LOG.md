I looked for patterns. |

| Aug 23 |    12:00    | I started with the cesar cipher shift, since that one was pretty easy. I just shifted the value of the characters by 9. Next I started working on the ascii values in numbers, I converted the ints to chars using (char) int which gave me a letter that corresponded to the ascii values. |
